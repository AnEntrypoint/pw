# Pending validation

Each line names a change, the file it touches, and the witness that must be green before the push. Status after Phase B (commit 24646cc): all rows green, `npm test` exit 0, `node test/memory.cjs` exit 0.

- test/support.cjs, test/lifecycle.cjs, test/leases.cjs, test/tools.cjs, test/memory.cjs (T1): each test process carries a unique PWP_TEST_TOKEN in its environment; a test stops only processes carrying its token, and finishTest fails the run if any of its processes is still alive after the grace. Witness: `npm test` passes, and no test prints a leftover error.
- test/tools.cjs (T2): the raw child runs with PLAYWRITER_DIRECT, so it starts no CDP relay. Witness: `lsof -t -iTCP:19988 -sTCP:LISTEN` shows the same pids before and after `node test/tools.cjs`.
- test/memory.cjs (M1): per-type table, idle page close, reopen check. Witness: `node test/memory.cjs` prints afterPageIdle and reopened with title "again".
- bin/playwriter-project (B1): trimmed Chromium flags, --disable-gpu unless PLAYWRITER_WEBGPU=1, one renderer per site. Witness: memory.cjs browser table after the change, and npm test green.
- bin/playwriter-project (B2): idle pages closed while a lease is held (PLAYWRITER_PAGE_IDLE_MS, default 60000); the browser stays up. Witness: memory.cjs afterPageIdle has fewer page targets, reopened returns "again".
- docs/CONSUMERS.md (D1): pin updated to the commit that carries B1 and B2. Witness: the pin resolves to that commit on origin.

Round 3 (idle held lease, renderers, gate RSS):

- bin/playwriter-project (R1): the browser path is resolved in a short-lived node child, so the gate never loads playwright-core. Witness: memory.cjs gate RSS falls from about 118 MB to about 60 MB.
- bin/playwriter-project (R2): calls mark their lease busy and idle through /__pwp/busy; the gate exits when no browser is up and no call is in flight for a grace; the launcher retires its child and lease when its browser has gone idle, and reopens on the next call. Witness: test/leases.cjs reopenAfterIdle and idleSessionWhileSharedCallRuns pass.
- bin/playwriter-project (R3): --renderer-process-limit=1, and the startup about:blank tab closes once another page exists. Witness: memory.cjs renderer count below 4 with one page.
- test/leases.cjs, test/memory.cjs (R4): the new lease scenarios and the idle wait for retirement. Witness: npm test exit 0; memory.cjs exit 0.
- docs/CONSUMERS.md (R5): final pin and the note that the relay needs no work in this repo. Witness: the pin resolves on origin.

Round 4 (first-open page survives a gate restart):

- patches/playwriter+0.9.0.patch (F1, applied to node_modules/playwriter 0.9.0 by the postinstall patch-package --error-on-fail; test/patch.cjs fails when it is missing): connectToBrowser in dist/executor.js (direct and extension branches, lines 737 and 764) and src/executor.ts (973 and 1010) takes the first page in the default context through defaultBrowserContext when browser.contexts() is empty, instead of browser.newContext(). The headless branch is unchanged. Witness: npm test passes with test/patch.cjs first, and npm run f1 (test/firstpage.cjs) prints firstPageSurvivedGateKill: true after the gate SIGKILL and restart. Open: the same repro also passes without the patch, so it does not show the loss the owner reports (see docs/UPSTREAM_PLAYWRITER.md). The patch is temporary.
